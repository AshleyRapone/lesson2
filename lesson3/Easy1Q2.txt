Describe the difference between ! and ? in Ruby. And explain what would happen in the following scenarios:
1. what is != and where should you use it?
   != means not equal to.
   You should use in when you are writing conditional statements

2. put ! before something, like !user_name
   ! before something means not
   so !user_name means opposite of user_name

3. put ! after something, like words.uniq!
   It permanently changes the value of the object

4. put ? before something
   It is the ternary operator for if... else
   boolean ? true : false

5. put ? after something
   ? after something is part of the method name

6. put !! before something, like !!user_name
   used to turn any object into their boolean equivalent
